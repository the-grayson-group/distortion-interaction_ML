# Example Directory

In this directory there is a .ipynb file which takes the user through replicating the results found within the paper associate with this Git. This example is for ds2 using the SVR model. Below is a step by step to using this file.

1. Set up environment as per [requirements file](../requirements.txt).
2. Open and run the [ipynb file](example.ipynb).

As stated in the notebook, random seeds chosen by the user will matter. The hyperparameter tuning for all models presented in this work was performed using the random seed 23.

This example is provided as is and minor alterations may be required to get the code to work on different systems.
