# Reaction Barriers

In this directory there is sub-directories that have reaction barriers, distortion and interaction energies. Each pickle file is in the same format and the data can be saved to figures using ``` view.py ```.

Each directory contains the data files for each dataset used in this project. Within each dataset's directory, there is energy files for distorted reactants (dist_gs), ground state reactants (gs), and transition structure (ts). There is also figures showing the spread of data for the datasets and targets.
